
before new features:

clean and simplify code.

organise output.

further check formulaic results again with 'straight count 60' mode: no formulas, pure counts per minute, output values refresh once per minute
	- pure 60s counter
	- record results
	- once a minute, compare results to results recorded from the inversely proportional time window version
	- if necessary, experiment with taking the average between N lowest lows and N lowest highs (currently average is of N highest highs)
	- compare results again
	- experiment more if necessary

	INDOORS:

	- typical estimated values of CPM usually between 8 CPM and 12 CPM indoors at current location.

	- pure 60s readings indoors at current location (precision every 60s - as precise as the hardware (esp32) can support, which we can measure in time):
	60s: 16 CPM
	60s: 12 CPM
	60s: 10 CPM
	60s: 12 CPM
	60s: 13 CPM
	60s: 16 CPM
	60s: 12 CPM
	60s: 17 CPM
	60s: 18 CPM
	60s: 10 CPM
	60s: 10 CPM
	60ss: 8 CPM
	60s: 17 CPM
	60s: 18 CPM
	60s: 19 CPM
	60s: 8  CPM
	60s: 8  CPM
	60s: 5  CPM
	60s: 12 CPM
	60s: 7  CPM
	60s: 18 CPM
	60s: 14 CPM
	60s: 10 CPM
	60s: 14 CPM

	- results per minute conclude that indoors, the CPM Burst Guage actually provides a reasonable estimation of the actual current CPM,
	  results also show that the CPM Burst Guage is not precise which is to be expected because the burst guage estimates while the pure 
	  counter actually counts counts every 60 seconds.

	Conclusion (predicated upon indoor results):
		Estimated values from the CPM Burst are valuable and can be very accurate but it will probably not be precise.
		Estimation Pro: Hits in the ball park accurately on a cold boot (immediately).
		Essimation Con: Although cpm is in the ballpark, cpm is not precise.

		Therefore: Estimation has its place because it can be extremely accurate however if precision is preferred then a 60 second
			   warmup should be applied and then each period of time (according to the required precision) should be deducted along
			   with any counts that occured during that period of time, before calculating the 'actual' CPM.
			   Pros: Precision to the degree hardware will allow.
			   Cons: Requires a 60 second warmup and must remain ON in order to maintain precision without requiring another 60 second
				 warmup.
	
	outdoors:

	- typical outdoor estimated readings in current location using the CPM Burst Guage range between 8 CPM and 70CPM.
	- the question is 'How does it scale?': how do the reults from the indoor ESTIMATED readings vs indoor PRECISION readings SCALE 	    	  	  commpared to outdoor ESTIMATED (CPM Burst Guage) readings vs outdoor PRECISION readings.
	- Next: measure outdoors with the pure 60 second counter.
